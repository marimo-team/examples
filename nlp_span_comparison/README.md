# NLP Span Comparison

[![Open in marimo](https://marimo.io/shield.svg)](https://marimo.app/github.com/marimo-team/examples/blob/main/nlp_span_comparison/nlp_span_comparison.py)

This notebook can be used as a template for comparing NLP models that predict
spans. Given two models and a sequence of text examples from which to extract
spans, the notebook presents the model predictions on each example and
lets you indicate which model yielded the better prediction. Your preferences
are saved (and loaded) from storage, letting you use this as a real tool.

To use this notebook for your own data, just replace the implementations
of the following three functions:

* `load_examples`: Load your own examples (strings) from a file or database.
* `model_a_predictor`: Predict a span for a given example using model A.
* `model_b_predictor`: Predict a span for a given example using model B.

The notebook keeps track of your preferences in a JSON file. To track
preferences in a different way, such as in a database, replace the implementations
of the following two functions:

* `load_choices`
* `save_choices`

## Running this notebook

Open this notebook in [our online
playground](https://marimo.app/github.com/marimo-team/examples/blob/main/examples/nlp_span_comparison/nlp_span_comparison.py)
or run it locally.

### Running locally

The requirements of each notebook are serialized in them as a top-level
comment. Here are the steps to run the notebook:

1. [Install `uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
2. Open an example with `uvx marimo edit --sandbox <notebook-url>`

> [!TIP]
> The [`--sandbox`
> flag](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/package_reproducibility/) opens the
> notebook in an isolated virtual environment, automatically installing the
> notebook's dependencies ðŸ“¦

You can also open notebooks without `uv`, in which case you'll need to
manually [install marimo](https://docs.marimo.io/getting_started/index.html#installation)
first. Then run `marimo edit <notebook-url>`; however, you'll also need to
install the requirements yourself.
