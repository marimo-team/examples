  <em>A curated collection of example <a href="https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo">marimo</a> notebooks.</em>
</p>

This repository contains a curated collection of example
[marimo](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo) notebooks. Use these notebooks
as starting points for your own data exploration, experimentation, workflows,
and apps.

## Running example notebooks

Each example has a README that tells you how to run it locally.

Most examples can also be opened in marimo's [online
playground](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/publishing/playground/) by clicking
the "open in marimo" badge in its README.

## Adding new examples

We welcome community contributions of examples; you don't need to be
an expert to help out!

Open a pull request to contribute a new example. Each example should be placed
in its own folder and include a short `README.md`.

Looking for a specific example or template but can't find it? Feel free
to file an issue and request it!
